            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>This Statement describes the actions taken by Upwork Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Upwork,” “we” or
                    “our”) during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 (the “Reporting Period”) to prevent modern
                    slavery and human trafficking in our operations and our supply chains pursuant to the UK Modern
                    Slavery Act 2015 and the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018. In order to prepare this statement,
                    Upwork Inc. consulted with the entities that it owns or controls.</p>
                <p>Upwork provides an online marketplace that enables businesses to connect with independent
                    professionals and agencies for all their hiring and remote work needs. On Upwork, talent markets
                    their services directly to prospective clients. Businesses and professionals use Upwork for remote,
                    knowledge-based work, and payments must be made through the platform.</p>
                <p>Upwork operates primarily in the United States, with an office in California. As of December 31,
                    2024, Upwork had approximately 600 employees, nearly all of which are based in the United States,
                    and throughout the Reporting Period, Upwork engaged approximately 2,200 contingent workforce team
                    members through its work marketplace to provide services on a variety of internal projects. These
                    remote freelancers were highly skilled knowledge workers based in 90 countries. Independent
                    professionals who use Upwork’s work marketplace to engage our clients are neither employees nor
                    suppliers of Upwork.</p>
                <p>The majority of our direct suppliers are based in the United States and provide goods and services
                    (e.g., software products, legal services, advertising support) with a low modern slavery risk.
                    Upwork does not outsource significant operations to agencies or other entities that engage workers
                    on behalf of Upwork without Upwork having visibility into such arrangements.</p>
                <p>Upwork is opposed to all forms of human trafficking, slavery, servitude, child labor, forced or
                    compulsory labor and all other trafficking-related activities. We are committed to (i) fully
                    complying with all applicable labor and employment laws, rules and regulations, and (ii) working to
                    mitigate the risk of human trafficking in our business and supply chains.</p>
                <p>Based on the nature of our business, our geographical footprint, and the limited goods and services
                    we procure, we believe that our operations are low risk with respect to modern slavery and human
                    trafficking practices. Our workforce is primarily made up of skilled employees and freelancers,
                    which further supports our low-risk profile. However, we recognize that most organizations have a
                    risk of modern slavery, if not in their direct operations, then further down their supply chain.
                    Areas that could represent a higher risk of modern slavery for Upwork include our procurement of
                    electronic products, such as laptops, computers, and mobile phones, which may be manufactured from
                    resources extracted in countries where forced labor and human trafficking is common.</p>
                <p>Our <a href="">Human Rights Commitment</a> (our “Commitment”) clarifies our commitment to human
                    rights and describes
                    our efforts to address possible human rights risks across our operations, supply chain, and work
                    marketplace. Our Commitment honors internationally recognized human rights principles and outlines
                    our expectations of our team members and suppliers. Our Commitment outlines our expectations of our
                    customers, both the clients and independent talent that use Upwork, and the steps we are taking to
                    build a work marketplace that reduces human rights risks and actively supports trust and safety. We
                    also clarify our commitment to use and develop technology responsibly and to effectively govern and
                    implement the commitments included in the statement in everything we do.</p>
                <p>In addition, Upwork’s <a href="">Code of Business Conduct and Ethics</a> (the “Code”) requires that
                    our employees,
                    independent contractors, officers and directors obey the law while performing work for Upwork and
                    comply with U.S. laws, rules and regulations governing the conduct of business by U.S. citizens and
                    corporations outside the United States. The Code contains a specific requirement that Upwork and its
                    employees comply with all applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Upwork
                    trains all employees and officers and certain independent contractors in Code policies as part of
                    the onboarding process. Upwork’s Whistleblower Policy and Speak Up program indicate that Upwork
                    expects its employees to internally report concerns about activity that is unlawful or otherwise
                    violates Upwork’s policies, including our Commitment and the Code, and provides reporting procedures
                    for team members who wish to anonymously submit a concern or complaint regarding such matters. The
                    Code includes reporting procedures and provides for protection against retaliation for those making
                    a report. If Upwork becomes aware of a violation of its policies, including our Commitment and the
                    Code, Upwork will reasonably investigate the matter and take appropriate action, which can include
                    required training, warnings, and/or employment termination. Furthermore, if Upwork becomes aware
                    that laws, rules or regulations have been violated, including human rights laws, Upwork will
                    cooperate fully with the appropriate authorities.
                <p>Upwork’s Supplier Code of Conduct further clarifies our expectations of suppliers with regard to
                    human rights and fair labor practices and shares the specific steps we’re taking to assess human
                    rights risks across our supply chain.</p>
                </p>
                <p>As the <a href="">Supplier Code of Conduct</a> states, Upwork expects that suppliers will prohibit
                    and take steps to
                    avoid all forms of human trafficking, slavery, servitude, child labor, forced or compulsory labor,
                    and all other trafficking-related activities within their value chains. Among other practices, the
                    Supplier Code of Conduct states that suppliers will:</p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure that they do not employ any persons under the legal age of employment as per ILO
                        Convention 138;</li>
                    <li>Enable employees to discontinue their employment freely upon reasonable notice;
                    </li>
                    <li>Compensate their employees fairly and follow local wage regulations;
                    </li>
                    <li>Follow all applicable laws and regulations with respect to working hours and days of rest, at a
                        minimum, and ensure that overtime is voluntary and that workers paid on an hourly basis do not
                        exceed 60 hours per week, except in emergency or unusual situations;
                    </li>
                    <li>Respect employees’ right to freely associate and collectively bargain;</li>
                    <li>Practice fair and proper hiring, firing, and evaluation practices and provide employees’ access
                        to their identity or immigration documents, such as government-issued identification, passports,
                        or work permits; and</li>
                    <li>Engage their suppliers to minimize and respond to human rights risks and/or violations.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>Upwork’s standard vendor agreements require that vendors adhere to applicable laws, rules and
                    regulations.</p>
                <p>During the Reporting Period, Upwork joined the UN Global Compact as a “Signatory member,” committing
                    to responsible business practices and annual reporting related to human rights, labor, environment,
                    and anti-corruption. We also conducted employment-related business due diligence regarding the
                    operations of suppliers that provide staffing services prior to engagement to ensure that such
                    vendors had appropriate employment practices in place and complied with all employment laws and
                    regulations. To assess and manage human rights risks across our supply chain, Upwork evaluates the
                    human rights commitments and employment practices of our suppliers. We do this through our Request
                    for Proposal (RFP) exercises and through an annual supply chain risk assessment, led by our
                    Sustainability and Impact team. Suppliers are expected to provide reasonable assistance to any
                    investigation or audit by Upwork, including of an alleged or suspected violation of our Supplier
                    Code of Conduct. Where human rights risks or evidence of human trafficking is found in our supply
                    chain, Upwork will engage relevant suppliers to manage said risks and/or terminate the business
                    relationship.
                </p>
                <p>Upwork reports on its efforts to assess and respond to human rights risks across its operations and
                    supply chain in its annual impact reports, which can be found at Upwork’s <a href="">ESG Reports
                        Hub</a>.</p>
                <p>This statement was approved by the Board of Directors of Upwork Inc. in their capacity as the
                    principal governing body of Upwork Inc. on February 5, 2025.</p>
